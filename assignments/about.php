            Hi everyone! My name is Alex and I live in a beautiful city in North San Diego
county. I have lived and traveled all around the world. I am a Senior majoring in Web Design 
and Development. I am in my final 2 semesters of school so I am extremely excited to see the light at the end of this tunnel (and "senioritis" is definitely kicking in)! Along with my studies, I also do Portrait Photography, a Graphic Designer for a small family-run Etsy company, and the Laurel advisor in my ward. I enjoy anything creative and artistic.
I love spending the [summer] days at the beach with my kids and having beach picnics with my brother
and sister-in-law. We also love Disneyland, WonderCon, and Comic-Con. I would have to say that fresh 
sashimi, sushi, and thai spring rolls are my favorite things to eat, but I do love any great food
and am willing to try almost any type of cuisine.
 
BYU-I has provided such a wonderful opportunity for me to finish my degree online, 
while still being able to work, and be a mom. I completed 3 years at BYU, but dropped out 
when I got married and I never finished my degree. Transferring to the UC school system in 
California would mean I would have to start my education over as a freshman and lose all 
of my 90+ credits. BYU-I enabled me to keep my Junior status and complete my degree. </p>
